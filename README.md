# SensorFusion
This repo contains all the assignments of online course [ChM015x Sensor Fusion and Non-linear Filtering for Automotive Systems](https://www.edx.org/course/sensor-fusion-and-non-linear-filtering-for-automot).  
## Future plans
This summer, I will review and reorginize some parts of the Matlab code with the help of this book:  
- [Simo Särkkä (2013). Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing. Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/dk/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/applied-probability-and-stochastic-networks/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing?format=HB)  You can find the [free electronic book here](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/)

Also, I'll do some analysis based on the origin course provided by Chalmers based on the matrials from this github [repo](https://github.com/macwu1992/Sensor-Fusion-and-Nonlinear-Filtering)
